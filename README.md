# pong_2

Here is a better version of the Pong game than the one I did a few months ago.
Added code:
1 - the ball increases speed every time it hits a paddle, and resets to its original speed once it resets to beginning when a paddle misses.
2 - when a player reaches a score of 3, then game is over and that player wins. I can reset the winning score to whatever value I wish.

Hope you enjoy!
